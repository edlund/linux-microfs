Don't you just hate how fast and reliable computers have
become lately? Good news; `sysdrain` can help you get access
to a slower, less stable experience by eating available CPU
time and free RAM doing completely useless things with it.

Joking aside, `sysdrain` exists to help make stress testing
easier for developers. Interesting bugs tend to show up when
the system starts running low on important resources and
`sysdrain` makes it easy to create such conditions.
